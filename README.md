# Graph Bundle Total Coloring

This repository contains the Python implementation of **Algorithm 1** from the paper:

**"Structural Decomposition, Algorithmic Complexity, and Total Coloring of Graph Bundles"** by M. Mohanraj and C. Vimala (IAENG Journal, 2026)

## 📁 Files
- `bundle_coloring.py` – Main implementation of Algorithm 1 for total coloring of path bundles (P_m \times F).
- `experiments.py` – Script to reproduce the experimental results shown in **Table I** and **Table II** of the paper.

## 📦 Requirements
- Python 3.9 or higher
- NetworkX (`pip install networkx`)

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/mathsmohanraj/graph-bundle-coloring.git](https://github.com/mathsmohanraj/graph-bundle-coloring.git)
   cd graph-bundle-coloring
